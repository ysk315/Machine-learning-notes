I have consolidated and put together a notes from which i learnt from diffrent sources. I would like to keep it as random than to explain in each 
subject area in detail.

Guidelines while working  Maching learning projects :

1. There are many number of classifiers in ML through which we achieve a solution. when we have encountered a typical sceanrio where in we have 
multiple classifiers with multiple conditions like (accuracy and performance in milli seconds).It is good to use below formula and choose
classifier which gives minimum of it
                 Formula: accuracy -0.5*time in milli seconds
                 
 2. Difference between recall, precision and F1 score.
 F1 score is the average of reacll and precsision.
 Precision is percentage of examples that were classified as positive 
 Recall is the total percentage of Truly classified examples out of the psoitively classified  examples.
